the [GetMeaning.lua](https://github.com/frostyio/vm/blob/master/GetMeaning.lua) was not made by me and was taken out of 
[Rerubi](https://github.com/Rerumu/Rerubi/blob/master/Source.lua)

[vm.lua](https://github.com/frostyio/vm/blob/master/vm.lua) was modeled off of [ANoFrillsIntroToLua51VMInstructions.pdf](http://luaforge.net/docman/83/98/ANoFrillsIntroToLua51VMInstructions.pdf)
[vm.lua](https://github.com/frostyio/vm/blob/master/vm.lua) is not complete and i'm probably too lazy to finish it when I have no real meaning for it.
